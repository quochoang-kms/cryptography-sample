# Cryptography Sample Project

This is a pet project focused on exploring and implementing cryptography techniques, with a primary emphasis on AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). The goal is to provide practical examples and hands-on experience with modern encryption methods for securing data.

## Features

- Demonstrates AES encryption and decryption in various modes (GCM, CBC, CTR)
- Explains the strengths and weaknesses of each AES mode
- Provides sample code and documentation for easy understanding
- Encourages best practices for key management and data security

## Project Structure

- `exercise 01/`: Contains exercises and documentation related to AES encryption techniques

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Explore the exercises and documentation in each folder.
3. Run the sample code to see cryptography in action.

## Motivation

This project is created for learning purposes, to deepen understanding of cryptography concepts and their real-world applications.
